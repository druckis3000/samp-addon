# SA-MP Addon
## Compatible with most recent SA-MP 0.3.7 R4-2 version

This addon adds various San Andreas patches and additional features in order to make game easier and more entertaining.

## Features

- Fast connect (skips SA-MP loading screen)
- No FPS limit
- FPS counter
- Lock weather
- Unlimited draw distance
- Infinite NOS, Oxygen
- Quick turn, bunny hop & speed hack for cars
- Toggle nametags & change max distance of them
- ESP (it actually just shows nametags through walls)
- ALT+TAB without pause (/afk command for toggling)

It also contains few cheats/bots made specifically for one server that I used to play. Shouldn't be interesting for others, but I didn't bothered removing them, might still be useful someday.

## Compiling

All this project was written on Linux machine, compiled with mingw32 compiler. Everything seems to be working, but I never tested it in Windows environment, thus I cannot guarantee that it compiles and works for you 100% exactly like it does on my machine.

I included my own makefile for compiling, you can take a look at it to see how this addon is compiled and try it on Windows.
